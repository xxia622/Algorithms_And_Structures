# Algorithms_And_Structures
A repository dedicated to mastering data structures and algorithms, featuring my solutions to LeetCode, Codeforces, and fundamental templates.

This repository tracks my journey through Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, with a focus on C++ implementations.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- [ ] Complete foundational structures (LinkedList, Trees, Graphs)
- [ ] Prep for **UCR CS010C** (Spring 2026)
- [ ] Solve 100+ LeetCode problems before Summer 2026 internship applications

## 📂 Structure
- `/Templates`: Standard implementations of algorithms.
- `/LeetCode`: Categorized problem solutions.
- `/Notes`: Concept summaries and complexity analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Time/Space Complexity Optimization ($O(n \log n)$, $O(1)$ space, etc.)
