This repository serves as a systematic practice and review lab for Data Structures and Algorithms while pursuing my **Computer Science with Business Applications (CSBA)** degree at **UC Riverside (UCR)**. It documents my progress in building the fundamental skills required to engineer efficient and scalable systems.

## Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundations (Current)** - Pre-studying for **CS010C** (Spring 2026) and implementing core linear/non-linear structures.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Advanced Algorithms** - Deep diving into Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, and advanced retrieval algorithms.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Interview Sprint** - Completing 200+ curated LeetCode problems with a focus on multi-dimensional complexity optimization before the Summer 2026 application window.

## Directory Structure
| Folder | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/Templates` | Standard C++ implementations of high-frequency algorithms | Weekly Updates |
| `/LeetCode` | Categorized solutions with Time/Space complexity analysis | Daily Sync |
| `/UCR_CS010C_Prep` | Implementation of low-level structures required for UCR coursework | In Progress |
| `/Notes` | Technical summaries on Big-O theory and C++ Memory Management | Continuous |

## Technical Focus
I adhere to these core principles in every implementation:
1. **Performance First**: Every line of code is scrutinized for **Time/Space Complexity**, striving for $O(n \log n)$ or better efficiency.
2. **C++ Best Practices**: Strictly following memory management standards, utilizing pointers and modern C++ features for low-level optimization.
3. **Readability**: Maintaining professional naming conventions and clear logic documentation, even for competitive programming tasks.

## Current Progress
- **Mastered**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Recursion...
- **In Progress**: Binary Search Trees (BST), Heap Sort...
- **Upcoming**: Union-Find, Segment Trees...
