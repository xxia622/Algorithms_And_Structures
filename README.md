# Algorithms & Data Structures 🚀

This repository is dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, serving as a comprehensive lab for my technical interview preparation and academic growth at UCR.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- [ ] Implement core data structures (LinkedList, Trees, Graphs) for **UCR CS010C** (Spring 2026).
- [ ] Solve 100+ LeetCode problems, focusing on C++ optimization.
- [ ] Maintain a library of high-performance algorithm templates ($O(n \log n)$ focus).

## 📂 Structure
- `/Templates`: Reusable C++ standard algorithm templates (Sorting, Searching, etc.).
- `/LeetCode`: Categorized problem solutions with time/space complexity analysis.
- `/UCR_CS010C_Prep`: Pre-study and implementation for upcoming coursework.
- `/Notes`: Summary of key concepts (Big-O, Memory Management).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Time/Space Complexity Optimization.
